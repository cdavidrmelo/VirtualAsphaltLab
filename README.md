# virtual-pavement-lab
Virtual Pavement Lab generates virtual asphalt pavements for spatial statistical analysis. This project simulates realistic pavement specimens to study material behavior and optimize design using advanced modeling. Integrating spatial stats and machine learning, it enhances asphalt performance insights for smarter infrastructure solutions.
